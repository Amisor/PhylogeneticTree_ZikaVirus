# Data Files description

The following script contains a descirption of the files that this directory contains 

## 30_sequences

The file correspond to the output of the 30 sequences from the GenBank query : "Zika virus envelope protein (E) gene".
Note that GenBank queries are indifferent about capital using capital letter. sequences length were restricted from 1 to 1000 nucleotides.

The aligment of the 30 sequences resulting from MUSCLE. 

The output tree of SimplyPhylogeny with default parameters with Neighbor Joining analysis. 

The metadata created by running codes 01_ to 0_3 of the src directory.
